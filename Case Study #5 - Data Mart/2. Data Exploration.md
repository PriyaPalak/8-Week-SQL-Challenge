# üè™ Case Study #5: Data Mart

## üìù Solution 2. Data Exploration

*Now that we're done with cleaning, let's explore the data and answer some business questions.*

### 1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  week_date,DATENAME(weekday,week_date) AS day_of_week
FROM clean_weekly_sales
ORDER BY week_date;
````
**Answer:**

- Monday is used to represent the week for each week_date value.

### 2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
  week_number,calendar_year
FROM clean_weekly_sales
ORDER BY week_number,calendar_year;
````
**Answer:**

![Screenshot 2023-06-14 124249](https://github.com/PriyaPalak/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/96012488/936964ab-f2e1-4301-a882-cb4484f59e21)

- Thus, we have data for the week numbers 13 to 36 for the 3 years. The missing week numbers are 1 to 12 and 37 to 52.

### 3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

````sql
SELECT 
  calendar_year,FORMAT(SUM(transactions),'0,,M') AS total_transactions
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year
ORDER BY total_transactions;
````
**Answer:**

![Screenshot 2023-06-14 124525](https://github.com/PriyaPalak/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/96012488/f98efd9a-8035-46df-8297-560cef3e0f48)

````sql
/*
The FORMAT function has a way of trimming the thousands.

Each comma reduces the displayed value by 1000.

e.g.

select format(3000000,'$0,,,.000B')
select format(3000000,'$0,,M')
select format(3000000,'$0,K')

(note that I had to use decimals to show 3 million in Billions)

Output:
$0.003B
$3M
$3000K

*/
````

- Year 2020 accounts for the maximum number of transactions.
### 4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?

````sql
SELECT 
  region,month_number,calendar_year,FORMAT(SUM(sales),'$0,,,.00B') total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY region,month_number,calendar_year
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
````
**Answer:** 

![Screenshot 2023-06-14 124742](https://github.com/PriyaPalak/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/96012488/7e85ada8-6f34-4c3b-87f4-ff336821aed9)

- Maximum sales value is for the region Oceania during August 2020.

### 5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform?

````sql
SELECT 
  platform,FORMAT(SUM(transactions),'0,,M') count_transactions
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY platform
ORDER BY SUM(transactions);
````
**Answer:**

![Screenshot 2023-06-14 124852](https://github.com/PriyaPalak/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/96012488/623a9153-a84c-4f8d-ba78-d590566662fc)

- Thus, the total count of transactions through the retail stores is much larger than  that of online Shopify stores.

### 6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

````sql
WITH monthly_sales_cte AS
(
SELECT 
  calendar_year,month_number,platform, SUM(sales) monthly_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year,month_number,platform

)
SELECT 
  calendar_year,month_number,
  ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN  platform = 'Retail' THEN monthly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(monthly_sales),2) retail_percent,
  ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN  platform = 'Shopify' THEN monthly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(monthly_sales),2) shopify_percent
FROM monthly_sales_cte
GROUP BY calendar_year,month_number;
````
**Answer:**

![Screenshot 2023-06-14 125623](https://github.com/PriyaPalak/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/96012488/522cede5-0bad-4e56-92c4-d8634045d50b)

````sql
/* 
Approach: We created a CTE for monthly sales of each platform by grouping sales by platform, month and year. 
Then, we created 2 new columns as follows: 
- If the platform is 'Retail' take the monthly sales and divide by sum of monthly sales for that group(month,year),else null. 
And we take the Maximum of the percentage and null which gives the retail percentage.
- Similarly, we calculate the Shopify percentage.
*/

### 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

````sql
WITH yearly_sales_cte AS
(
SELECT 
  calendar_year,demographic,SUM(sales) yearly_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year,demographic
)
SELECT 
  calendar_year,
  ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Families' THEN yearly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(yearly_sales),2) families_percent,
  ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Couples' THEN yearly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(yearly_sales),2) couples_percent,
  ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN demographic = 'unknown' THEN yearly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(yearly_sales),2) unknown_percent
FROM yearly_sales_cte
GROUP BY calendar_year;
````

**Answer:**

### 8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?

````sql
SELECT 
  age_band,demographic,SUM(sales) AS retail_sales, ROUND(100*SUM(sales)/SUM(SUM(sales)) OVER(),2) AS contribution_percent
	-- Cannot apply aggregate function to an aggregate value, need to use the OVER() clause with SUM(SUM(sales))
FROM clean_weekly_sales                                  
WHERE platform = 'Retail'
GROUP BY age_band,demographic
ORDER BY retail_sales DESC;
````
**Answer:** 

![Screenshot 2023-06-14 130104](https://github.com/PriyaPalak/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/96012488/d9bc2c17-5712-4b9b-8e5a-dca0ac8cc021)

- The maximum contribution to the retail sales is made by 'unknown' age_band and demographic at 42% followed by retired families with 16.7% and retired couples with 16.07%.

### 9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

````sql
SELECT 
  calendar_year,platform,
  ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction),0) AS avg_avg_transaction_size,
  ROUND(SUM(sales)/SUM(transactions),0) AS avg_transaction_size
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year,platform
ORDER BY calendar_year,platform; 
````
**Answer:**

![Screenshot 2023-06-14 130222](https://github.com/PriyaPalak/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/96012488/7b07b5b6-5d56-4286-8032-a5128fafec80)

````sql
/*
- Average of averages(of each group) is equal to the average of all the groups combined only when the number of elements in 
each group is same. Otherwise, the two calculations give different vales.
- The more accurate answer to the average of all the groups combined is achieved by the second way, as we calculate the 
average as per its definition in this way by taking the sum and dividing by the number of elements.
- Attempting to average existing averages without knowing the number of values contained in each value leads to statistical 
errors. 
- Either use the original values or keep hold of the number of values included in the average in order to keep your numbers 
accurate.

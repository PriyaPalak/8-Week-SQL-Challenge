# :convenience_store: Case Study #5: Data Mart

## Business Task:

Data Mart is an online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce. After running its international operations, Danny wants to analyse his sales performance.
Also, in June 2020, the company shifted to using sustainable packaging methods in every single step of the production. Danny needs help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and its separate business areas.

## :memo: Solution 1. Data Cleansing Steps

*First, we perform some data cleaning before we start to answer Danny's key business questions in depth.*

**(a) Convert the week_date to a DATE format.**

````sql
ALTER TABLE dbo.weekly_sales
ALTER COLUMN week_date DATE;
````

**(b) Add week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc.**

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD week_number AS DATEPART(week,week_date);
````
- Here, we take help of a computed column to add `week_number` to the existing table `weekly_sales`. This works in SQL Server.
- To position the column after week_date, we can use `AFTER` directive in the `ADD` statement. This works in MySQL Workbench.
However, it doesn't work in SQL Server. So, we need to use the System Interface to reorder the columns as desired.

**(c) Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column.**

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD month_number AS DATEPART(month,week_date);
````

**(d) Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values.**

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD calendar_year AS DATEPART(year,week_date);
````

**(e) Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value:**

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD age_band AS CASE WHEN segment LIKE '_1' THEN 'Young Adults'
                     WHEN segment LIKE '_2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
                     WHEN segment LIKE '_3' OR segment LIKE '_4' THEN 'Retirees'
                     ELSE NULL
                     END;
````

**(f) Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:**

![Screenshot 2023-03-02 122458](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96012488/222353614-f13702f7-00cb-4734-848f-beb73e457a58.png)


````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD demographic AS CASE WHEN segment LIKE 'C_' THEN 'Couples'
                        WHEN segment LIKE 'F_' THEN 'Families'
                        ELSE NULL
                        END;
````

**(g) Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns.**

````sql
UPDATE weekly_sales
SET segment = 'unknown'
WHERE segment = 'null';
````

- I tried updating all the 3 columns using a single UPDATE statemnt, however, computed columns cannnot be modified like this.
- To change the 2 computed columns, age_band and demographic, we need to drop these columns and recreate them.

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
DROP COLUMN age_band,demographic;
````

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD age_band AS CASE WHEN segment LIKE '_1' THEN 'Young Adults'
                     WHEN segment LIKE '_2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
                     WHEN segment LIKE '_3' OR segment LIKE '_4' THEN 'Retirees'
                     ELSE 'unknown'
                     END;
````
````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD demographic AS CASE WHEN segment LIKE 'C_' THEN 'Couples'
	                      WHEN segment LIKE 'F_' THEN 'Families'
	                      ELSE 'unknown'
	                      END;
````

**(h) Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record.**

- `avg_transaction` is computed by the division of two integer columns sales and transactions. 
- Integer division results in truncation of fractional part, whereas we want the value rounded to 2 decimal places.
- So, let's change the data type of one of the columns, say sales, to FLOAT.(DECIMAL/NUMERIC keep the insignificant zeros even afer rounding off, so we'll go with Float).

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ALTER COLUMN sales FLOAT;
````

- Now, Let's add the column `avg_transaction` by dividing sales by transactions and using the ROUND function to set it upto 2 decimal places.

````sql
ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD avg_transaction AS ROUND(sales/transactions,2);
````

- Now, we need to generate a new table clean_weekly_sales which contains data with all the above steps performed.

*For this, I'm gonna rename this table to clean_weekly_sales. Then, I'll recreate the old table and name it weekly_sales. This is the opposite way of doing it. The straight way would be to create a copy of the original table, name it clean_weekly_sales and make given changes to it.*

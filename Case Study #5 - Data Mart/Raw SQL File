-- Database Creation Completed

USE data_mart;

-- Table imported as a flat file from MySQL Output(as number of rows to be inserted was greater than 1000)

-- Let's begin the analysis!

/* 1. DATA CLEANSING STEPS

The following case study questions require some data cleaning steps before we start to unpack Danny’s key business questions in more depth.

*/

-- In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

-- 1. Convert the week_date to a DATE format

-- While importing the table here, SQL Server automatically identified the data type of "week_date" column and converted it into DATE from VARCHAR(7). 
-- Infact, when I changed it back to VARCHAR(), it didn't allow the import of the table. So, I don't need to do it.

ALTER TABLE dbo.weekly_sales
ALTER COLUMN week_date DATE;


--2. Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

ALTER TABLE dbo.weekly_sales
ADD week_number INTEGER AFTER week_date;

-- This way we can add a new column at a specific position in an existing table.

-- This query doesn't work in SQL Server as it does not support the 'AFTER' directive to add column at a specific position. However, it works in MySQL.
-- To perform this operation here, we need to make use of System Interface and follow the following steps.

/* 
- First, just add each column the usual way (as the last column).

- Secondly, in SQL Server Management Studio Get into Tools => Options.

- Under 'Designers' Tab => 'Table and Database Designers' menu, uncheck the option 'Prevent saving changes that require table re-creation'.

- Afterwards, right click on your table and choose 'Design'. In 'Design' mode just drag the columns to order them.

- Don't forget to save.
*/

-- Now, we want to populate this column based on an existing column 'week_date'
-- However, all this can be done in a single step. We don't need to ADD --> REORDER --> POPULATE.
-- We can simply add column which is populated accordingly using 'ADD column_name AS condition'
-- In this case, we don't need to specify the DATA TYPE of the column as system identifies it based on the values filled in the column.


ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD week_number AS DATEPART(week,week_date);


--3. Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column.

ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD month_number AS DATEPART(month,week_date);


--4. Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values.

ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD calendar_year AS DATEPART(year,week_date);

--5. Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value.


ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD age_band AS 
	CASE WHEN segment LIKE '_1' THEN 'Young Adults'
	WHEN segment LIKE '_2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
	WHEN segment LIKE '_3' OR segment LIKE '_4' THEN 'Retirees'
	ELSE NULL
	END;


--6. Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values.

ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD demographic AS 
	CASE WHEN segment LIKE 'C_' THEN 'Couples'
	WHEN segment LIKE 'F_' THEN 'Families'
	ELSE NULL
	END;

--7. Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns.

UPDATE weekly_sales
SET segment = 'unknown'
WHERE segment = 'null';

-- I tried updating all the 3 columns using a single UPDATE statemnt, however, computed columns cannnot be modified like this.
-- To change the 2 computed column, age_band and demographic, we need to drop these columns and recreate them.

ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
DROP COLUMN age_band,demographic;


ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD age_band AS 
	CASE WHEN segment LIKE '_1' THEN 'Young Adults'
	WHEN segment LIKE '_2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
	WHEN segment LIKE '_3' OR segment LIKE '_4' THEN 'Retirees'
	ELSE 'unknown'
	END;

ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD demographic AS 
	CASE WHEN segment LIKE 'C_' THEN 'Couples'
	WHEN segment LIKE 'F_' THEN 'Families'
	ELSE 'unknown'
	END;

--8. Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record.

-- avg_transaction is computed by the division of two integer columns sales and transactions. 
-- Integer division results in truncation of fractional part, whereas we want the value rounded to 2 decimal places.
-- So, Let's change the data type of one of the columns, say sales, to FLOAT. I am not changing it to DECIMAL/NUMERIC because they keep the insignificant zeros even afer rounding off.

ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ALTER COLUMN sales FLOAT;

-- Now, Let's add the column avg_transaction by dividing sales by transactions and using the ROUND function to set it upto 2 decimal places.

ALTER TABLE weekly_sales
ADD avg_transaction AS ROUND(sales/transactions,2);


/* Now, we need to generate a new table clean_weekly_sales which contains data with all the above steps performed.

-- For that, I'm gonna rename this table to clean_weekly_sales. Then, I'll recreate the old table using that same flat file and name it weekly_sales.
-- This is the opposite way of doing it.

-- The straight way would be to create a copy of the original table and make changes to the copy table and rename it to clean_weekly_sales.

*/




/*

2. DATA EXPLORATION

*/

--1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

SELECT week_date,DATENAME(weekday,week_date) AS day_of_week
FROM clean_weekly_sales;

-- So, Monday is used to represent the start of the week for each week_date value.

--2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?

SELECT DISTINCT week_number,calendar_year
FROM clean_weekly_sales
ORDER BY week_number,calendar_year;

--Thus, we have data for the week number 13 to 36 for the 3 years. The missing week numbers are 1 to 12 and 37 to 52.

--3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

SELECT calendar_year,FORMAT(SUM(transactions),'0,,M') AS total_transactions
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year
ORDER BY total_transactions;

/*
The FORMAT function has a way of trimming the thousands.

Each comma reduces the displayed value by 1000.

e.g.

select format(3000000,'$0,,,.000B')
select format(3000000,'$0,,M')
select format(3000000,'$0,K')

(note that I had to use decimals to show 3 million in Billions)

Output:
$0.003B
$3M
$3000K

*/

-- Year 2020 accounts for the maximum number of transactions.

-- 4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?

SELECT region,month_number,calendar_year,FORMAT(SUM(sales),'$0,,,.00B') total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY region,month_number,calendar_year
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- Maximum sales value is for the region Oceania during August 2020.

--5. What is the total count of transactions for each platform?

SELECT platform,FORMAT(SUM(transactions),'0,,M') count_transactions
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY platform
ORDER BY SUM(transactions);

--Thus, the total count of transactions through the retail stores is much larger than  that of online Shopify stores.

--6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

WITH monthly_sales_cte AS
(
SELECT calendar_year,month_number,platform, SUM(sales) monthly_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year,month_number,platform

)
SELECT calendar_year,month_number,
	ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN  platform = 'Retail' THEN monthly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(monthly_sales),2) retail_percent,
	ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN  platform = 'Shopify' THEN monthly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(monthly_sales),2) shopify_percent
FROM monthly_sales_cte
GROUP BY calendar_year,month_number;

-- Approach: We created a CTE for monthly sales of each platform by grouping sales by platform, month and year. Then, we created 2 new columns as follows: 
-- If the platform is 'Retail' take the monthly sales and divide by sum of monthly sales for that group(month,year),else null. And we take the Maximum of
-- the percentage and null which gives the retail percentage.
-- Similarly, we calculate the Shopify percentage.

--7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

WITH yearly_sales_cte AS
(
SELECT calendar_year,demographic,SUM(sales) yearly_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year,demographic
)
SELECT calendar_year,
	ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Families' THEN yearly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(yearly_sales),2) families_percent,
	ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN demographic = 'Couples' THEN yearly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(yearly_sales),2) couples_percent,
	ROUND(MAX(CASE WHEN demographic = 'unknown' THEN yearly_sales ELSE NULL END)*100/SUM(yearly_sales),2) unknown_percent
FROM yearly_sales_cte
GROUP BY calendar_year;

--8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?

-- We have to find out which age_band and demographic combination accounts for the most of the retail sales.

SELECT age_band,demographic,SUM(sales) AS retail_sales, ROUND(100*SUM(sales)/SUM(SUM(sales)) OVER(),2) AS contribution_percent
	-- Cannot apply aggregate function to an aggregate value, need to use the OVER() clause
FROM clean_weekly_sales                                  
WHERE platform = 'Retail'
GROUP BY age_band,demographic
ORDER BY retail_sales DESC


-- The maximum contribution to the retail sales is made by 'unknown' age_band and demographic at 42% followed by retired families with 16.7% and retired couples with 16.07%.

--9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

-- Average of averages(of each group) is equal to the average of all the groups combined only when the number of elements in each group is same.
-- Otherwise, the two calculations give different vales.
-- The more accurate answer to the average of all the groups combined is achieved by the second way, as we calculate the average as per its definition in this way by taking the sum and dividing by the number of elements.

SELECT calendar_year,platform,ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction),0) AS avg_avg_transaction_size,ROUND(SUM(sales)/SUM(transactions),0) AS avg_transaction_size
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year,platform
ORDER BY calendar_year,platform; 

/*
Attempting to average existing averages without knowing the number of values contained in each value leads to statistical errors. 
Either use the original values or keep hold of the number of values included in the average in order to keep your numbers accurate.
*/



/*

BEFORE & AFTER ANALYSIS

-- This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

*/

-- In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

-- Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it’s separate business areas.

-- Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

-- We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before.

-- So, let's first see which week the changes were introduced.

SELECT DATEPART(week,'2020-06-15');

-- The changes were introduced in week number 25.
-- 12 weeks before 25th week : period before change;
-- 12 weeks including and after 25th week: period after change



-- 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

WITH sales_8_weeks AS
(
SELECT week_date,week_number,SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 28)
AND (calendar_year = 2020)
GROUP BY week_date,week_number
)
, before_after_change AS
(
SELECT 
	SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN total_sales END) AS sales_before_change,
	SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sales END) AS sales_after_change
 FROM sales_8_weeks
)
SELECT 
	(sales_after_change - sales_before_change) AS impact_on_sales,
	ROUND(100*((sales_after_change - sales_before_change)/sales_before_change),2) AS impact_percentage
FROM before_after_change;

-- Thus, the total sales reduced in the period after change by an amount of $26,884,188, reflecting a negative change by 1.15%.
-- The possible reasons could be : customers didn't recognise the product on the shelves due to new packaging, 
-- or they opted for a cheaper alternative as sustainable changes often lead to higher prices.

--2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

-- A similar approach can be used to address this question.

WITH sales_24_weeks AS
(
SELECT week_date,week_number,SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 36)
AND (calendar_year = 2020)

	ROUND(100*((sales_after_change - sales_before_change)/sales_before_change),2) AS impact_percentage
FROM before_after_change;

-- If we consider the entire 12 weeks before and after the change, the decline in sales in the after period is even higher at a negative of 2.14%.

--3. How do the sales metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

-- Let's first compare the sales metrics for 4 weeks before and after with the previous years 2018 and 2019.

-- The same approach can be used here. We just need to add calendar_year into the context.

WITH sales_8_weeks AS
(
SELECT calendar_year,week_date,week_number,SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 28)

	SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sales END) AS sales_after_change
 FROM sales_8_weeks
 GROUP BY calendar_year
)
SELECT calendar_year,
	(sales_after_change - sales_before_change) AS impact_on_sales,
	ROUND(100*((sales_after_change - sales_before_change)/sales_before_change),2) AS impact_percentage
FROM before_after_week_25;

-- In 2018, the sales increased by an amount of $ 4,102,105, indicating a positive change of 0.19% in the period after changes were introduced.
-- Similarly, in 2019, the sales saw a rise amounting to $ 2,336,594, corresponding to a positive change of 0.1% in the period after packaging change.

-- However, in 2020, there has been a significant drop in sales following the introduction of sustainable packaging. The sales declined by $ 26,884,188, reflecting a percentage drop of 1.15%.
-- This reduction shows a significant impact on sales compared to the previous years 2018 and 2019.



-- Now, let's repeat this analysis for a period of 12 weeks.



-- For this, we just change the week number to 13 to 24 for before period and 25 to 36 for after period.

WITH sales_24_weeks AS
(
SELECT calendar_year, week_date,week_number,SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 36)
GROUP BY calendar_year,week_date,week_number
)
, before_after_change_week AS

 FROM sales_24_weeks
 GROUP BY calendar_year
)
SELECT calendar_year,
	(sales_after_25 - sales_before_25) AS impact_on_sales,
	ROUND(100*((sales_after_25 - sales_before_25)/sales_before_25),2) AS impact_percentage
FROM before_after_change_week
ORDER BY calendar_year;

-- As we can see above, in 2018, the sales increased by 1.63% in the period after change. While in 2019, a slight drop of 0.3% was observed.
-- In 2020, however, the drop is even more significant at a staggerring 2.14%!

-- Thus, there has been a significant impact on sales in 2020 due to packaging changes compared to the previous years, 2018 and 2019.

-- When we compare the best year (2018) wih the worst year (2020), the variation in sales becomes even more apparent with a drop of 3.77% (1.63% + 2.14%).



/*

BONUS QUESTION

*/

-- Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?

-- region
-- platform
-- age_band
-- demographic
-- customer_type

-- The approach is similar to comparing 12 weeks period before and after change, with the focus on a specific area of business.
-- So, we'll just break down the numbers by that specific area of business, e.g., region.

--1. Region

WITH sales_24_weeks AS
(
SELECT region,week_date,week_number,SUM(sales) AS total_sales

	ROUND(100*((sales_after_change - sales_before_change)/sales_before_change),2) AS impact_percentage
FROM before_after_change
ORDER BY impact_percentage;

-- Asia saw the highest negative impact on sales in 2020, with a decline of 3.26% in sales after packaging change.
-- The metrics show that the sales declined in  every region except Europe. In fact, the sales saw a growth of 4.73% in Europe after the sustainable changes were introduced.
-- This might be possible due to more inclination of Europeans toward sustainability. Maybe, they prefer sustainable products and don't mind paying slightly more in return.


-- Platform

WITH sales_24_weeks AS
(
SELECT platform,week_date,week_number,SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE (week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 36)

FROM before_after_change
ORDER BY impact_percentage;

-- Offline Retail stores saw a drop in sales by 2.43%, while Online Shopify stores observed a rise in sales by 7.18%.
-- A possible explanation for this could be that Online customers of Data Mart are more inclined toward sustainable products compared to offline customers.




-- Age_band

FROM before_after_change
ORDER BY impact_percentage;

-- There has been a decline in sales across all the age groups after the packaging changes were introduced. However, the decline is highest in the unknown
-- age group at a negative of 3.34%, whereas the 'Young Adults' group saw the lowest drop in sales due to packaging change at a negative of 0.92%.

-- Demographic

WITH sales_24_weeks AS

	ROUND(100*((sales_after_change - sales_before_change)/sales_before_change),2) AS impact_percentage
FROM before_after_change
ORDER BY impact_percentage;

-- Again, there has been a decline in sales across all demographics after the packaging changes, with the highest decline in the unknown demographic at a negative of 3.34%.
-- While the 'families' demographic saw a drop of 1.82%, the drop in 'Couples' demographic was only 0.87%. 
-- This might be because Families usually have more expenses and responsibilities compared to Couples. Hence, they find it difficult to pay a higher price for sustainable products and thus opt for cheaper alternatives.
-- Couples, having less expenses and responsibilities, find it easier to afford slightly expensive sustainable products and thus stay loyal to the brand.

-- Customer_type

FROM before_after_change
ORDER BY impact_percentage;

-- Sales reduced by 3% in the Guest Customers category, and by 2.27% in Existing Customers category. Meanwhile, 'New Customer' Category saw a rise in sales by 1.01%.
-- A possible explanation could be that the brand, after making these changes, attracted new customers who are more into sustainable products and thus the sales increased in this category.
